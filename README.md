# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
In this assignment we were tasked with completing starter code to create a fully functional E-Commerce backend. This was a great assignment for reinforcing sequelize, MySql, and express. It was also great for reinforcing how all 3 of them tie together to make a fully functional database. I felt like this assignment was a great mix of starter code and my own code.
